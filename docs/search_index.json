Better description will follow There is one sub-page [link] that will provide a summary of all people currently offering providing their support for various methods-related question in our department, such as general data wrangling, statistical modeling, or the use of GPS (and related) collars. The other page [link] will show the current schedule of ‘office hours’ and how to contact the people with office hours. Some people will have office hours at a fixed day and time, whereas others can be contacted to setup a meeting.
