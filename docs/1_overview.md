Here is a list with all people interested in providing support including their areas in which they can provide support.


```r

people_support_area <- people %>% 
  left_join(support_area, by = "Name_ID")

people_support_area %>%

  summarize(Areas = paste(Support_areas, collapse = ", ")) %>% 
  ungroup %>% 
  select(FirstName, Areas) %>% 
  kable()
#> `summarise()` has grouped output by 'Name_ID'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.
